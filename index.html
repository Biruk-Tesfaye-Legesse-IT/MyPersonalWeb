                <p>Hello there! My name is Biruk Tesfaye Legesse. I’m an student at Addis Ababa University.</p>
                <p>I was born in October 1999 G.C. in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I completed elementary school in Fountain of Knowledge
                    School then went on to Safari academy to finish High School and Preparatory School. I am a big &nbsp; fan of sports. 
                    Soccer mainly interests me. I also  like watching series movies with a sitcom genre. I love music and 
                    pop an rock songs are my choices. I've always regretted not having a take charge type of personality which is 
                    of great benefit to people. I enjoy going to movie theaters every now and then. Though if I'm ever in a complex 
                    it's usually for video games which I know by now I must have outgrown. One of my greatest flaws has always been 
                    lack of concentration on a single matter over a long period of time which I'm working on. I'm a friendly 
                    and relatable person. My role models are every successful people technology wise all around 
                    the world as I thrive to become one someday. I occasionaly involve in charity. I am dedicated to growing better each day
                     because I don't believe nothing good has ever come out of a static and a tedious cycle.</p>

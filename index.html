                <p>Hello there! My name is Steven Kinnear. I’m a Physician, Freelance Consultant, Philomath and Doctorpreneur.</p>
                <h3>Physician</h3>
                <p>I’m a GP Principal at Silverbirch Medical Practice in Bangor, Co. Down.  Prior to undertaking training in General Practice on the North Down rotation I was a Medical Manager at the Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland for three years and prior to this I was a Registrar in Acute Medicine.  I was formerly a GMC Associate for Visits to Deaneries.  I was then appointed as a GMC Fitness to Practice Panellist through open competition before transferring to the Interim Orders Panel under the new Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service (MPTS).</p>

                <p>Many explain social media as a phenomena of the new age. Considering its power at this point it would be no exaggeration if it was reffered
                    to as an "alternate reality". By its nature it requires engagement of people sharing many of the moments in their lives. Therefore it has an
                    entertainment aspect to it that is addictive. Be that as it may, it is no lie that despite its disadvantages social media is necessary for almost
                    all of us around the world. Here are a couple of reasons I think people should use social media.  </p>
                    
                   <ol>
                    <li><h3>It is the simplest form of communication</h3></li>
                    <p>Social media unlike other forms of communications is very simple. Considering it requires much less human interaction, anyone with any kind
                        of social anxiety can go on to social and be themselves. And it gives you the advantages of sharing with everyone, everywhere. </p>
                    
                    <li><h3>It is easy to gather information</h3></li>
                    <p>Thanks to the engagement of people on social media it is easier to get information or massive public opinion from it. This information can be used
                        to help improve the topic commented upon. The anonymity gives people the chance to be honest with you without fear of hurting you.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>You build relationships</h3></li>
                    <p>Before the age of social media people hardly knew about things or people half way accross the world from them. Now due to social media people have 
                        friends all over the world and they know about their cultures, This not only creates an open-minded community but also helps create and maintain relationships
                        all over the world which otherwise wouldn't have been possibele.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>You share insights</h3></li>
                    <p>The main thing about social media is sharing. Some share their experiences others share their culture and so on. But people also share valuable
                        insights which help others see the world from a different angle, perhaps from one the source of the idea proposed. This plays a big role in people
                        being more understanding and considerate. 
                    </p>
                    
                   </ol>

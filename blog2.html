                <p>Exams however we don't want to admit it are an essential part of a students' life. Apart from testing how much you've learnt in a semester
                    exams have become a measure of intelect and worth in the world right now. While being a good student and studying go a long way in achieving
                    good results in exams, they don't ensure it. Here is where being a good exam taker comes in handy. Good exam takers achieve good grades with
                    minimal effort on their part. It is proven that the things you do before an exam can have their positive or negative effect of their own. 
                    Hence a student should develop these habits to help with exams. Here are some tips that can help a student become a good exam taker.</p>
                    
                   <ol>
                    <li><h3>Don’t study too late</h3></li>
                    <p>It is a common trend among students to have a late night studying session the night before the exam under the illusion that you are making the most your time.
                        But by denying your brain the chance to rest it is very likely that you remember very little of what we studied. And this habit could result in being 
                        over exhausted right before of during the exam. </p>

                    <li><h3>Review your study notes</h3></li>
                    <p>A more productive and a less stressful use of the night before the exam would be reviewing your previously ready notes. This habit
                        not only helps you remember the contents of the subject matter but also boosts your confidence to for the exam.</p>
                    
                    <li><h3>Prepare for the morning</h3></li>
                    <p>An exam morning shouldn't be improvised rather you should have a plan with an optimised usage of time. If the morning of your exam day
                        starts with a chaos there is a great chance your attention could scatter even before the exam starts. 
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>Get everything you'll need for the exam together</h3></li>
                    <p>You should organize everything you'll nedd for the exam. Your items should be stocked and ready for a pickup and go. Trying to look for your items 
                        in the morning of the exam is a bad habit because in the off chance where you can't find something, you will panic you from the start. 
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>Arrive to the place of examination with time to spare </h3></li>
                    <p>One of the keys to taking exams is being calm and comfortable in the where you are supposed to be taking the exam. If you arrive late settling into
                        the environment is going to be a challenge, the sense of already being behind in the exam won't help either.
                    </p>
        </ol>

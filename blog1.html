                <p>I take interest in psychology because it fascinates me as science. But the art of deduction of human behaviour has 
                    always intrigued me. And telling if people are being dishonest is a part of it. I did a little research
                    on it and I thought I would share what I found. These are a couple of signs that people are telling a lie.</p>
                   <ol>
                       <li><h3>Eye Contact</h3></li>
                       <p>Eye contact is a dead give away. Normal eye contact lasts three to five seconds, any longer could mean people have other intentions towards
                           you while any shorter means they are avoiding eye contact to hide something.</p>

                        <li><h3>Changes in pitch of voice </h3></li>
                        <p>People’s voices tend to get higher when they’re lying. This might go to the point of voice cracking without the speaker not even noticing. 
                            At this point even companies use your voice to tell that you are genuine. Your voice is being monitored by fraud protection software. 
                            If the software detects stress or tension in the voice, they will know something is up.</p>

                        
                        <li><h3>Stress nerves</h3></li>
                        <p>People’s noses go very pale or red when they lie. It is often reffered to as the Pinocchio effect. There’s also a nerve in the back of the neck that 
                            people often rub when stressed. Sweating is always a big sign. </p>
                        
                        <li><h3>Pointing their fingers </h3></li>
                        <p>The act of pointing at or toward something or someone else may signal a desire to take a focus off of an individual and onto someone else. 
                            If they point their finger in a different direction than the way their eyes are looking, they could also be telling a lie.
                        </p>

                        <li><h3>Taking a long pause</h3></li>
                        <p>They may pause a lot as they work to construct details in their head or to explain their actions using a storyline that really 
                            didn’t occur.</p>
                   </ol>
